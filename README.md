# 0x04. TypeScript

This project introduces TypeScript and its core features including typing, interfaces, classes, generics, and DOM manipulation. It is part of the ALX Frontend curriculum and aims to help you write safer and more maintainable JavaScript code using TypeScript.

---

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- Basic types in TypeScript
- Interfaces, Classes, and Functions
- How to work with the DOM and TypeScript
- Generic types
- How to use namespaces
- How to merge declarations
- How to use an ambient Namespace to import an external library
- Basic nominal typing with TypeScript

---

## Requirements

- **Allowed editors:** vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- **All your files should end with a new line**
- **All your files will be transpiled on Ubuntu 18.04**
- **Your TS scripts will be checked with Jest (version 24.9.\*)**
- **A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory**
- **Your code should use the `.ts` extension when possible**
- **The TypeScript compiler should not show any warning or error when compiling your code**

---

## Setup / Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/frontend-javascript.git
```

2. Navigate to the TypeScript project folder:

```bash
cd frontend-javascript/0x04-TypeScript/task_0
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

5. (Optional) Start the development server:

```bash
npm run start-dev
```

6. Run tests (if any):

```bash
npm test
```

> 🔹 Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.  
> 🔹 Repeat steps 2–5 for each `task_x` folder if needed.

- Each `task_x` folder is independent and contains its own TypeScript setup.
- The `js/` folder contains the main TypeScript files for that task.
- The `dist/` folder is created after building and contains the compiled JavaScript bundle.

## Tasks

### Task 0

- **Folder:** `0x04-TypeScript/task_0/`
- **Description:** In this task, I explored basic TypeScript types. I wrote TypeScript code in `js/main.ts`, then compiled it to JavaScript using Webpack. This helped me understand how TypeScript enforces types and how to set up a basic TypeScript project.
